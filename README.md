# 🎵 SwiftUI Apple Music "Reputation" Album UI

This project is a **SwiftUI design exercise** that visually recreates part of the Apple Music interface to display an album screen.

## 📱 What does this app do?

This is a **non functional demo**  it **does not play music** or connect to any API. The goal is to **practice layout and visual design** by replicating a music album UI, including:

- 🖼️ Album artwork display  
- 🎤 Album title and artist name  
- 📆 Genre, release year, and audio quality (visual only)  
- 🔘 Custom `Play` and `Shuffle` buttons  
- 📃 A stylized song list with track numbers  
- 🎧 Download and menu icons on each track  
- 🧭 Bottom tab navigation bar using `TabView`

## 💡 What I practiced

- Building UI using `VStack`, `HStack`, `ZStack`  
- Styling with `.background`, `.cornerRadius`, `.shadow`  
- Creating dynamic views with `List`, `ScrollView`, and `ForEach`  
- Using consistent design with `.foregroundColor`, `.opacity()`  
- Creating reusable components like `albumCard`  
- Implementing tab navigation with SF Symbols

## 🛠️ Technologies

- SwiftUI  
- SF Symbols  
- Xcode 15+
